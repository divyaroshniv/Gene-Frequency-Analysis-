# **Gene Frequency Analysis**

## Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium Gene Frequency Modelling
In a simple bi-allelic system (alleles A and a), we define the frequencies as:
- p: Frequency of the dominant allele (A)
- q: Frequency of the recessive allele (a)
- The fundamental equation: p + q = 1

   To predict genotype frequencies, we use:
     p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1
